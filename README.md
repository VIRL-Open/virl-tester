# README.md

this is the readme file for *virltester*

to make it work with containers (like the mgmt LXC) you also do need to manually
clone my fork of paramiko expect:

`pip install git+https://github.com/rschmied/paramiko-expect.git`

Lacks coherent Examples and better documentation in general. Some of them are
plain wrong (as the YAML has evolved over time :) ) and some are redundant /
misplaced etc.

The Examples/test.yml and the simple.yml in the baseline directory in Examples
*should* work.
